# UFOs

## Overview
To build a webpage and dynamic table for Dana that allows for multiple filters for UFO sightings.

## Results
Since there is a large amount of data available that may be beyond the scope of what someone is looking for, we have added the ability to perform filters to get a more specific list of what someone may be looking for.  You simply need to enter any information into the box you would like filtered and hit the tab or enter key to apply the filter.

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is that you can only enter one value per filter option. For example you can't choose a date range.

Recommendations to improve funcionality of the website:
1. Add the ability to choose multiple options to filter.
2. Add the ability to enter the date in other formats.  Currently the date field has to be entered as a specfic format(m/d/yyyy), however, if someone enters a format in a different way then no results are returned.
